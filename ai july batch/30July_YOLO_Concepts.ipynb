    "2) It takes the entire image in a single instance and predicts the bounding box coordinates and class probabilities for these boxes. The biggest advantage of using YOLO is its superb speed – it’s incredibly fast and can process 45 frames per second. YOLO also understands generalized object representation."

    "2) The framework then divides the input image into grids (say a 3 X 3 grid):<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"yolo2.png\">\n",
    "3) Image classification and localization are applied on each grid. YOLO then predicts the bounding boxes and their corresponding class probabilities for objects (if any are found, of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exmaple\n",
    "Suppose we have divided the image into a grid of size 3 X 3 and there are a total of 3 classes which we want the objects to be classified into. Let’s say the classes are Pedestrian, Car, and Motorcycle respectively. So, for each grid cell, the label y will be an eight dimensional vector:\n",

    "If there is no obejcts in the grid<br>\n",

    "Since there is an object in this grid, pc will be equal to 1. bx, by, bh, bw will be calculated relative to the particular grid cell we are dealing with. Since car is the second class, c2 = 1 and c1 and c3 = 0. So, for each of the 9 grids, we will have an eight dimensional output vector. This output will have a shape of 3 X 3 X 8.\n",
